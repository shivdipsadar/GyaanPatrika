Perfect 🚀
You want a **complete guide + roadmap** for building a **Quiz Website using MERN stack in a single day**.
I’ll break it into **time-boxed steps**, so if you follow this, you can have a working MVP by the end of the day.

# 🧭 Roadmap: Build a Quiz Website in 1 Day (MERN Stack)

---

## **Phase 1: Setup & Planning (1 hour)**

✅ Decide core features for MVP:

* User authentication (signup/login with JWT).
* Create quizzes (title, description, questions, options, correct answer).
* Take quizzes (MCQs, auto-scoring).
* View results (score, correct/incorrect answers).

✅ Stretch features (optional if time left):

* Share quiz link with others.
* Leaderboard / analytics.
* Upload PDF and extract questions automatically.

✅ Tech stack:

* **Frontend**: React + TailwindCSS
* **Backend**: Express.js + Node.js
* **Database**: MongoDB (Atlas)
* **Auth**: JWT
* **Deployment**: Render/Netlify/Vercel (if time allows)

---

## **Phase 2: Backend Setup (3 hours)**

1. **Initialize project**

```bash
mkdir quiz-app && cd quiz-app
npm init -y
npm install express mongoose cors dotenv jsonwebtoken bcrypt
```

2. **Setup Express server**

* `server.js` → setup Express, CORS, dotenv.

3. **Connect MongoDB**

* Use MongoDB Atlas connection string.

4. **Models**

* `User.js` (username, email, passwordHash).
* `Quiz.js` (title, description, questions).
* `Question` schema inside `Quiz` (text, options, correctAnswer).
* `Result.js` (userId, quizId, score).

5. **Routes**

* `/api/auth` → signup/login (JWT).
* `/api/quiz` → CRUD quizzes.
* `/api/attempt` → submit answers & calculate score.
* `/api/result` → fetch past results.

6. **JWT Middleware** for protecting quiz routes.

---

## **Phase 3: Frontend Setup (3 hours)**

1. **Initialize React app with Tailwind**

```bash
npx create-react-app client
cd client
npm install axios react-router-dom
npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
npx tailwindcss init -p
```

2. **Tailwind config** → setup.

3. **Pages/Components**:

* `Login.jsx` & `Signup.jsx`
* `Dashboard.jsx` (list quizzes)
* `CreateQuiz.jsx` (form to add questions)
* `TakeQuiz.jsx` (fetch quiz → attempt)
* `Result.jsx` (show score & answers)

4. **Routing** using `react-router-dom`.

5. **Auth Context** for JWT token management.

---

## **Phase 4: Core Features Implementation (4 hours)**

1. **Auth Flow**

* Signup/Login → get JWT → store in localStorage → use Axios interceptor.

2. **Quiz Creation**

* Form to add title + questions + options + correct answer.
* Save to backend.

3. **Quiz Taking**

* Fetch quiz by ID.
* User selects answers.
* Submit → backend calculates score → returns result.

4. **Results Page**

* Show user’s score + correct/incorrect answers.

---

## **Phase 5: Polish & Deployment (2–3 hours)**

✅ UI polish with Tailwind (cards, buttons, inputs).
✅ Protect routes (redirect if not logged in).
✅ Deploy:

* Backend → Render / Railway.
* Frontend → Netlify / Vercel.

---

# ⏳ Time Plan for One Day

* **Hour 1** → Setup & planning.
* **Hours 2–4** → Backend (models, routes, JWT).
* **Hours 5–7** → Frontend (auth, dashboard, quiz CRUD).
* **Hours 8–10** → Quiz taking + scoring + results.
* **Hours 11–12** → Polish UI + Deploy.

---

# 🚀 Extra (If Time Left)

* Add Leaderboard (aggregate results by quiz).
* Shareable links (`/quiz/:id`).
* PDF → Quiz extraction (using `pdf-parse`).
* Charts (score breakdown using Recharts).

---

Would you like me to also **give you folder structure + code skeletons** (backend + frontend) so you can directly start coding without wasting time?



Analytics for Admin → show how many users attempted each quiz, average score, top scorers.

Leaderboard → per quiz / global ranking of users.

Frontend Integration (React + Tailwind) → start connecting APIs to UI for users/admins.

Extra Features → quiz time limit, negative marking, categories/tags, randomized questions.
